<h1>My Post App - Firebase</h1>

The purpose of this application is to provide a platform for users to share posts once they have registered and logged in. React (Vite) was used to develop a frontend with optimal efficiency, while Firebase was used to handle the backend and user administration. Firebase Authentication is linked with the functions for user sign-up, sign-in, and forgotten password. React-router-dom facilitates page switching inside the application. Because routing rules are dynamically defined, users cannot reach the post-sharing page in the program without first logging in. After logging in, users can make a post and share it right away. User-submitted posts are safely kept in the database and distributed using Firebase Firestore. React-toastify users receive instant notifications about transactions. Notifications that appear on the screen, for instance, let the user know when a post is shared or when they successfully log in.
